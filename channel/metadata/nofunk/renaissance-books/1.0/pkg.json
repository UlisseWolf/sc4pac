    "description": "Renaissance Books is a used book store on Plankinton Avenue in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Although many of the neighboring buildings are filled with cafes and charming shops and are generally well maintained, this little gem has avoided gentrification. Perfect for your grimier commercial streets, or add a little spice to your higher wealth districts!\n",
