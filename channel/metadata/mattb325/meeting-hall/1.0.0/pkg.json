    "description": "In many smaller towns and larger cities, meeting halls often took the place of the Town Hall. They were an important part of civic life, and while many had a quasi-religous purpose, many were purely non-sectarian.\nThis colonnaded Italianate building with its little tower is offered as a non-conditional reward and is a modified version of the Town Hall reward. It sits on a 2x3 lot and provides park and landmark effects.\n",
