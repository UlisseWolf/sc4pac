    "description": "Made as a request, this building is based on the Ballhaus Ost in Berlin. Originally a mourning hall, it has since been converted to a community space and theatre.\nThe BAT comes on a 2x3 lot and it is found in the reward menu. It offers a handful of jobs and will boost surrounding desirability for business and residential, as well as provide landmark, park and mayor effects.\n",
