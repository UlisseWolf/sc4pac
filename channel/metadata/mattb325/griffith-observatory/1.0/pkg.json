    "description": "The Griffith Observatory and Planetarium opened in 1935 and has a commanding view of the Los Angeles skyline from its prime position on the slope of Mount Hollywood in Griffith Park. It is an example of Art Deco & Streamline Moderne architecture.\nThis BAT is designed to have slope tolerance and the lot is designed to be plopped on a hill (rather than a cliff-face).\nThis building has been modded as a non-conditional reward that counts towards tourism and has a positive landmark, park and mayor-rating effect.\n",
