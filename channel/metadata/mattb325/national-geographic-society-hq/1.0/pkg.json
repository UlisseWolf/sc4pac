    "description": "The National Geographic Society Headquarters was built in 1963 in the what is known as the new formalist style.  It is made of concrete, marble and glass and conveys a uniform and symmetrical appearance; the marble columns provide strong verticality and are a reinterpretation of earlier classical, temple like forms. This is especially true of the upper floors and projecting fins along the colonnade.\nThis version is a high-capacity museum on a 6x2 lot, providing 235 civic jobs.\n",
