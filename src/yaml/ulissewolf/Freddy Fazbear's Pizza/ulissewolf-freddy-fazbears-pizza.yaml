  summary: "Freddy Fazbear's Pizza"
  description: >
    This prop pack is the beginning of a long series of prop packs inspired by the Five Nights At Freddyâ€™s
    Due to the particularity of modding, two versions of the Alert and News system were created.
    The original version will run the alert message whenever you enter the city that the landmark version of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza is present.
    The Non-invasive alert version, on the other hand, will show the alert message only when you have built the Landmark and will not appear when you load the city again
