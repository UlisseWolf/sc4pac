    "description": "Like the ingame Radio Station this lot is basically used as a cap buster; it increases desirability, mayor rating and also substantially lifts the demand cap for R$$ and Manufacturing jobs. Given how most of the industrial custom content available leans towards the manufacturing genre, these caps are usually hit fairly early, so placing the radio station in each city tile will assist in ensuring there is still regional demand for IM jobs.\nThe building was inspired by the Musick Point Padio Station in New Zealand which was built in the classic art deco style for use during WWII. It still stands today on a dramatically empty bluff looking out to sea.\nThis reward lot is offered without the need to satisfy pre-existing conditions, can be plopped more than once in a city, and, most importantly DOES NOT over-write the ingame radio station.\n",
