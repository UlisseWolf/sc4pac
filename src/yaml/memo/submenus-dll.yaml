  description: >
    This DLL plugin adds a number of submenus such as Plazas, Green Spaces, Sports and more.
    It is also a dependency for other submenu-compatible plugins which add items to these menus or add entirely new submenus.

    Additionally, the DLL implements the Exemplar Patching functionality and fixes the game's duplicate menu icons bug.
