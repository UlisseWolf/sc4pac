  summary: "A patch required to make seasonal flora work"
  description: >
    This patch corrects the Maxis Flora Tuning Parameters Exemplar for the use with seasonal tree controllers.
  conflicts: >-
    This patch is compatible with the Maxis-default terrain
    and with terrain mods not including the Flora Tuning Parameters Exemplar
    (Pyrenean terrain mod and terrain mods coming from the PLEX).
    All other terrain mods must override this patch with their own seasonal flora patch.
