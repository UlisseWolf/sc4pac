    "description": "This mod replaces all Maxis trees on lots with beautiful HD trees. Lots already existing in your city will automatically switch to the new trees. Whatever grows or is plopped subsequently will show the new trees in place of the old Maxis ones. Besides, it will replace roadside trees that occasionally show up at the sides of streets and roads.\nAll Mayor Mode and God Mode flora in the city map will remain unaffected. The growing lot flora will also be replaced, but with full-grown trees.\n",
