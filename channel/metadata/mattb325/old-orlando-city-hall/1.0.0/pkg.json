    "summary": "Old Orlando City Hall",
    "description": "This 8-floor building with two asymmetrical balanced lower wings is typical of many mid-century public American buildings.  They were solidly built with quality materials: limestone, marble and pink granite.\nThis building is offered as a non-conditional town hall reward. It provides 986 civic jobs and has all of the benefits (commercial and residential boost) of a town hall. Placing this building should see residential and commercial sky scrapers grow more easily in your city.\n",
