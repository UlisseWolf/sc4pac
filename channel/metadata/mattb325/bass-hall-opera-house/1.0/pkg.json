    "summary": "Bass Hall Opera House",
    "description": "The Bass Performance Hall is in Fort Worth Texas. It seats 2,056 people. Built as a multi-purpose facility, the Hall is able to house symphony, ballet, opera, stage, musicals, and rock concerts. The building is reminiscent of the classic European Opera Houses: the building is constructed of limestone and was built in 1998.\nIn game, this is offered as a non-conditional Opera House Reward. It does not override the in-game Opera House Reward.\nThe stats have been made in accordance with the opera house bug fix (the vanilla Maxis opera house fills up very quickly and then causes your city to have all sorts of problems), but please note that the bug fix is not necessary for this download.\nIt sits on a 4x4 lot and provides 281 civic jobs. It also gives a region-wide residential, commercial and IHT boost, and increases desirability in the surrounding radius.\n",
