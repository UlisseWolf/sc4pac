    "description": "This little building is inspired by a real such mid-century low rise building near downtown Los Angeles. In game, this supplements the main hospital function and the capacities have been modded to sit mid way between the clinic and standard hospital. But it will work equally well in a smaller city without the need for an additional hospital.\nIt sits on a 2x2 lot and provides 68 civic jobs.\n",
