    "summary": "A simple, yet idyllic church typical of rural New England",
    "description": "The New England style of Church surrounded by deciduous trees in autumnal hues is an often photographed building: they are - pictorially at least - an archetypal representation of the rural idyll of America's North East.\nThis BAT is typical of the style: quite utilitarian, made of weatherboard and timber painted in crisp white (including the steeple). The buildings have classical, greek-revival style elements such as dentil moldings and ionic columns executed in timber, but overall, they are restrained and unadorned.\nThis church is on a 2x3 lot and it is found in the reward menu. This church is modded in such a way as to be most beneficial to smaller towns, but of course it can be placed in a big city if you wish.\nIt will boost surrounding desirability for residential and provides cap relief as well as park and mayor effects. It also has some slope tolerance to enable you to replicate the typical new england small town scene.\n",
